# Yelp Camp 

The site is a clone of yelp! reviews, but is built so that it reviews various campgrounds all around the world. It is built using the Express framework of Node.js, with MongoDb as its database. The front-end is styled mostly using Bootstrap and Css. It is hosted with the help of Heroku's free plan and the remote mongoDb database is from Mongo Atlas.

In this project, I exercised my learnings in:

- **HTML**

- **CSS** (Bootstrap)

- **JavaScript** (EJS, Node.JS, Express)

- **MongoDB** + Mongoose

- **APIs** (REST)

- **MVC** architecture

And practiced working with tools that I have never had any experience before, like:

- **Passport** for authentication, authorization and cryptography

- **JOI** for data validation

- and **EJS Mate** made my development process a lot faster with boilerplating
